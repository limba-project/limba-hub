# Limba Hub

A web application building a [Limba](https://github.com/ximion/limba) software repository and performing
QA on the uploaded packages.
The Hub is designed to be used by multiple people with different repositories, and serves as central place to
host Limba packages.

This software is in early development, and might not work as you expect yet! Lots of features are missing,
and contributions and help is very welcome!
